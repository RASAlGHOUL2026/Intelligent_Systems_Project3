~ ONE-STEP FALL DETECTION ~

======================================================================================================================================

STEP 1:
Use the link bellow to have access to the file directory which contains the datasets for training,
validation and testing. After accessing the file, save a version of it into your own google drive.

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kYlW3YK4McZtqpYJxvcSvxzLRpoHJuKO?usp=sharing

======================================================================================================================================

STEP 2:
Open the 'one_step_final.ipynb' file using google colab. You can find this file in the folder provided or
on GitHub using this link:
https://github.com/RASAlGHOUL2026/Intelligent_Systems_Project3

======================================================================================================================================

STEP 3:
Run the first module to import necessary modules and libraries.

======================================================================================================================================

STEP 4:
Run the second module in which you will have to mount your google drive to the notebook.

======================================================================================================================================

STEP 5:
Run the function definition module

======================================================================================================================================

STEP 6:
**In this module (Training module) you might change the basic settings for the model training. (Image_size, batch_size and epochs)
If you do not wish to change them you can just run the module!
Wait until the code finishes running, by the end you should see two graphs.
This two graphs reprents the change in accuracy after each epoch for class labelling and bounding box prediction.

======================================================================================================================================

STEP 7:
Run the next module in order to obtain the testing dataset class label categorical accuracy as well as its confusion matrix.

======================================================================================================================================

STEP 8:
Run the following module. 
This module will display the predicted bounding boxes and class label for each image of the testing dataset.

======================================================================================================================================

STEP 9:
The last module is the GUI module in which after running it, you can drop an image and the predicted output
will be displayed after passing through the model.
The link above the GUI can be clicked and it will bring you to an online page representing the same gui
with better dimensions.
